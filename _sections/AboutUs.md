The Colonial Church of Christ is an independent congregation with no earthly headquarters of any kind. Christ is the head of the church, and 
He rules and directs the church through His word (2 Tim. 3:16-17). We simply strive to follow the commands and 
examples of the church described in the New Testament. We do not follow any human creeds or doctrines 
which have been created by man to falsely supplement God's Word. We use the Bible and only the Bible as our guide.
