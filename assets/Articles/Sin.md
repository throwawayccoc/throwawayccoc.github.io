<h3 style="text-align: center;">What does the Bible say about SIN?</h3>
<br/>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">Rom 3:23 </h4>
23.  For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; 
<br/>
Isaiah 59: 1-2  
 1.  Behold, the Lord's hand is not shortened, that it cannot 
     save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear:  
 2.  But your iniquities have separated between you and your 
     God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he 
     will not hear.  
<br/>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">Ezekial 18:20</h4>
 20. The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not 
     bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the 
     father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness 
     of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness 
     of the wicked shall be upon him.  
<br/>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">Acts 2:36-39</h4>
36.  Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, 
     that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, 
     both Lord and Christ.  
37.  Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, 
     and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men 
     and brethren, what shall we do?  
38.  Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every 
     one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission 
     of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.  
39.  For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and 
     to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God 
     shall call.  
<br/>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">Acts 22:16</h4>
16.  And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and 
     wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord
