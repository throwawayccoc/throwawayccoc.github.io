<h4 style="text-align: center;">Hebrews 11:1</h4>
1) Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.  

<br/>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">Hebrews 11:6</h4>
6) But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.  
<br/>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">James 2:19-24</h4>
19)  Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.  
20)  But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?  
21)  Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?  
22)  Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?  
23)  And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.  
24)  Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.  
<br/>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">Galatians 5:6</h4>
 6) For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, 
     nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.
