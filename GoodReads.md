### God's Part

2.	He gave His Son, Jesus Christ, as the Saviour (Luke 19:10)  
3. Sent the Holy Spirit as a guide (John 16:13)  
4.	Gave the Gospel as "the power" unto salvation (Romans 1:16)  
5.	Provided atonement by the blood of Christ (Romans 5:9)  

### Man's Part

1. Hear the Gospel. (Romans 10:17, John 8:32)  
2.	Believe the Gospel (Hebrews 11:6, John 20:31)  
3.	Repent of past sins (Luke 13:3, Acts 17:30)  
4.	Confess faith in Jesus Christ (Romans 10:10, Matthew 10:32)  
5.	Be Baptized (Galatians 3:27, Mark 16:16, Acts 2:38)

**If you have questions concerning your part of this great plan, continue reading.**  

<p style="text-align: center; color:red" color="Red"><i>"What must I do to be saved?"</i></p>

This is the question that every man and woman must answer in their lives if they hope to spend eternity with God in Heaven. The apostle Paul says, in Phil 2:12, to those of the church in Philippi,  

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>"Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, <u>work out your own salvation</u> with fear and trembling."</b></p>

Thus, we understand that it is our own responsibility to answer the question, "What we must do to be saved?" No one else can answer that question for us, nor can we trust others with this, most important, decision. We must seek our answer from God and His Word.
